# **Product Catalog Version Control with S3 Versioning**

## **Domain**: E-commerce

### **Problem Statement**
E-commerce platforms often face challenges in tracking changes to product listings, including descriptions, prices, and images. Without a reliable version control system, product data may become inaccurate, leading to inventory errors, pricing discrepancies, and poor customer experience.

### **Challenges**
- **Inaccurate or Outdated Product Listings**: Changes made to product listings, such as pricing updates or description edits, may not be tracked, leading to outdated information being displayed to customers.
- **Difficulty in Tracking and Comparing Product Updates**: Without version control, it’s hard to know what specific changes were made between product updates.
- **Overwritten or Lost Historical Product Data**: Overwriting previous versions of product data without tracking leads to the loss of valuable historical data that may be needed for audits, reviews, or comparisons.

### **Solution Overview**
The **Product Catalog Version Control** system leverages **S3 Versioning** to track changes made to product listings and associated media files. This ensures accurate historical records of product data, allowing e-commerce businesses to easily access previous versions of products, compare changes, and maintain data integrity.

### **How It Solves the Problem**
S3 Versioning offers a reliable version control system that tracks every update to product listings, such as changes in price, descriptions, or images. This enhances transparency, reduces errors, and provides an easy way to compare different versions of product data.

## **How We Will Solve the Problems**

1. **Enable S3 Versioning**: Store product data in an S3 bucket with versioning enabled, automatically keeping track of changes.
2. **Create a Version Control System**: Implement version control for product descriptions, images, and prices to track and compare updates over time.
3. **Develop a Comparison Tool**: Build an intuitive interface for viewing and comparing previous versions of product listings.

## **Features**
- **Version Control for Product Listings**: Automatically track and manage different versions of product data, including descriptions, images, and prices.
- **Track Product Media and Prices**: Not only descriptions, but also media files (images, videos) and pricing details are tracked with versioning.
- **Comparison Tool for Historical Data**: Users can compare changes in product descriptions, images, and prices between different versions for easy auditing or decision-making.
- **Product Metadata Management**: Maintain metadata related to each product version, such as who made the change, when it was made, and what specific changes were applied.

## **How It Works**

1. **Store Product Data in S3**: Product listings (descriptions, images, prices) are uploaded to an S3 bucket with versioning enabled.
2. **Track Updates and Revisions**: Each time a product listing is updated, S3 automatically creates a new version of the file.
3. **Compare Product Versions**: Users can access an interface to compare different product versions to review changes and verify updates.

## **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Set Up S3 Versioning**
Enable versioning on the S3 bucket used for storing product catalog data with the `enable_versioning.py` script.

```bash
python enable_versioning.py
```

### **Step 2: Upload Product Data**
Upload product information (descriptions, images, prices) to the S3 bucket using the `upload_product_data.py` script. Each update creates a new version.

```bash
python upload_product_data.py
```

### **Step 3: List Available Versions**
Use the `list_product_versions.py` script to list all available versions of a product.

```bash
python list_product_versions.py
```

### **Step 4: Compare Product Versions**
Users can compare different product versions using the `compare_product_versions.py` script, allowing them to see what changes have been made.

```bash
python compare_product_versions.py
```

## **Further Improvements**
- **Integration with Inventory Management Systems**: Sync product catalog versions with inventory management systems to keep stock data in sync with product changes.
- **Real-Time Product Version Comparison**: Allow real-time version comparisons when products are updated, ensuring accuracy and preventing discrepancies in live listings.
- **API for Integration**: Develop an API to integrate product catalog versioning into third-party e-commerce platforms or content management systems (CMS).

---

## **Conclusion**
The **Product Catalog Version Control** system improves inventory management and data integrity by ensuring that every product update is tracked, easily comparable, and fully auditable. This helps e-commerce businesses maintain accurate product listings, prevent errors, and improve the customer experience.
